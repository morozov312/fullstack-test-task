# Fullstack test app

Requirements:
- Use Angular
- Use TypeScript
- Use DevExpress for the table
- Dependency manager: npm / yarn
- Use Webpack for project build (generated by Angular CLI)
- Build a Docker image based on Nginx to run the developed SPA application

Frontend Application:
- A single-page SPA application that displays information about posts
- Data should be retrieved from your own backend
- Display the data in a DevExpress table â€“ use custom cell views and footer
- Provide the ability to delete records (with confirmation)
- Provide a form to add new records
- Create neat and tidy styling - the page should look complete

Backend Application:
- Use TypeScript / Express or NestJS
- Create a CRUD for posts for the frontend application
- Use an external API [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) for actual post data (i.e., our backend is just a proxy over the external API)
- Write tests

DevOps Part:
- Use a mono repository for both frontend and backend
- Create a docker-compose file to build the frontend and backend into their respective Docker images and run them
- The example should start with a simple command: docker-compose up
